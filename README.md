# React Notes

Notes taken while reading the official React docs.

## Why React?

React is a component-based library for building user interfaces. It has the backing of Facebook and is already being used at scale there.

## Do you have to go all in?

React can be added to an existing project or can be built from the ground up using a tool like Create React App.
